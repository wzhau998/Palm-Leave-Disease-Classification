# Palm-Leave-Disease-Classification

Implement image classification of palm leave disease using CNN, ResNet152-V2, VGG19, DenseNet201, MobileNet-V2 and InceptionResNetV2

## Description

This repository uses convolutional neural networks (CNN) in multi-image classification using the processed dataset. Aside from CNN, transfer learning was applied using ResNet152-V2, VGG19, DenseNet201, MobileNet-V2, and InceptionResNetV2 layers to perform image classification. 

The dataset was from  balanced data with classes of palm leaf diseases through data augmentation and implementing
