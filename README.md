# Palm-Leave-Disease-Classification

Implement image classification of palm leave disease using CNN, ResNet152-V2, VGG19, DenseNet201, MobileNet-V2 and InceptionResNetV2

## Description

This repository uses convolutional neural networks (CNN) in multi-image classification using the processed dataset. Aside from CNN, transfer learning was applied using ResNet152-V2, VGG19, DenseNet201, MobileNet-V2, and InceptionResNetV2 layers to perform image classification. 

The dataset or split_palmleaves1 was balanced with classes of palm leaf diseases through data augmentation and implementation before model training. It is a public dataset from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hadjerhamaidi/date-palm-data

## How to use

* Download and upload split_palmleaves1 to Google Drive
* Open Disease Classification.ipynb in Google Colab
* Edit the dataset path of split_palmleaves1, then run the Google Colab
* It is recommended to use T4 GPU to run the code
